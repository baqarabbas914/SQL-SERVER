-- Transact SQL also known as T-SQL 

Explain Transact SQL (T-SQL)

Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's proprietary extension to the 
standard Structured Query Language (SQL), used as the central language
 for communication with Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL Database. 
 It adds robust programming features to standard SQL's data management 
 capabilities. 

 T-SQL vs. Standard SQL
Standard SQL is a declarative language focused on what data to manage or query, while T-SQL, as a procedural language, adds functionality to define how those operations are executed through control flow and other programming constructs. 

Key differences include:
Procedural Programming: T-SQL allows for variables, loops (WHILE), and conditional logic (IF...ELSE, CASE), which are generally not part of standard SQL.

Scope and Compatibility: T-SQL is specific to the Microsoft SQL Server ecosystem (including Azure SQL Database). Standard SQL is a universal language supported across many different database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

Execution: Standard SQL statements are typically processed individually, whereas T-SQL allows for processing a group of statements as a single, logical block, which is essential for managing transactions.

Syntax Variations: There are minor keyword differences. For example, standard SQL uses LIMIT for restricting the number of rows returned, while T-SQL uses TOP. 

List different categories of T-SQL

T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is categorized in two primary ways: by the type of statements or commands used to interact with the database, and by the data types it supports. 

Categories of T-SQL Commands
T-SQL commands are generally grouped into five main categories based on their function: 

Data Definition Language (DDL): Commands used to define and manage database structures and objects (e.g., tables, views, indexes), but not the data itself.

CREATE: Creates new database objects.
ALTER: Modifies existing database objects.
DROP: Deletes database objects.
TRUNCATE: Removes all records from a table quickly (re-initializes the table).

Data Manipulation Language (DML): Commands used for managing the data within the database objects.
INSERT: Adds new records (rows) into a table.
UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.
DELETE: Removes specific records from a table.
MERGE: Performs inserts, updates, or deletes in a single statement.

Data Query Language (DQL): Commands used specifically for querying and retrieving data from the database.

SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.

Data Control Language (DCL): Commands used for controlling access, security, and permissions within the database.

GRANT: Gives access privileges to users or roles.
REVOKE: Removes access privileges from users or roles.
Transaction Control Language (TCL): Commands used to manage transactions and ensure data integrity (following ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
COMMIT: Permanently saves the changes made during a transaction.
ROLLBACK: Reverts changes if any part of the transaction fails.
SAVEPOINT: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.

Categories of T-SQL Data Types
SQL Server organizes its system-supplied data types into several categories based on their storage characteristics and the type of data they hold: 

Exact Numerics: int, bigint, smallint, tinyint, bit, decimal, numeric, money, smallmoney.
Approximate Numerics: float, real.
Date and Time: date, time, datetime, smalldatetime, datetime2, datetimeoffset.
Character Strings: char, varchar, text (for non-Unicode character data).
Unicode Character Strings: nchar, nvarchar, ntext (for Unicode character data).

Binary Strings: binary, varbinary, image.
Other Data Types: Includes types such as cursor, hierarchyid, sql_variant, table, uniqueidentifier, xml, and json. 


More on T-SQL - Data Types

SQL Server data type is an attribute that specifies types of data of any object. Each column, variable and expression has related data type in SQL Server. These data types can be used while creating tables. You can choose a particular data type for a table column based on your requirement.

SQL Server offers seven categories including other category of data types for use.

Exact Numeric Types
Type	From	                    To
bigint	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808	9,223,372,036,854,775,807
int	    -2,147,483,648	2,147,483,647
smallint	-32,768	32,767
tinyint	0	255
bit	0	1
decimal	-10^38 &plus;1	10^38 1
numeric	-10^38 &plus;1	10^38 1
money	-922,337,203,685,477.5808	&plus;922,337,203,685,477.5807
smallmoney	-214,748.3648	&plus;214,748.3647

Numeric and decimal are Fixed precision and scale data types and are functionally equivalent.

hierarchyid − A variable length, system data type used to represent position in a hierarchy (Introduced in SQL Server 2008).

T-SQL - Create Tables

Creating a basic table involves naming the table and defining its columns and each column's data type.

The SQL Server CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax of CREATE TABLE statement −

CREATE TABLE table_name( 
   column1 datatype, 
   column2 datatype, 
   column3 datatype, 
   ..... 
   columnN datatype, 
   PRIMARY KEY( one or more columns ));

CREATE TABLE is the keyword telling the database system what you want to do. In this case, you want to create a new table. The unique name or identifier for the table follows the CREATE TABLE statement. Then in brackets comes the list defining each column in the table and what sort of data type it is. The syntax becomes clearer to understand with the following example.

A copy of an existing table can be created using a combination of the CREATE TABLE statement and the SELECT statement. You can check complete details at Create Table Using another Table.

Example
In this example, lets create a CUSTOMERS table with ID as primary key and NOT NULL are the constraints showing that these fields cannot be NULL while creating records in this table −

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS( 
   ID   INT              NOT NULL, 
   NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL, 
   AGE  INT              NOT NULL, 
   ADDRESS  CHAR (25) , 
   SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),        
   PRIMARY KEY (ID));

ou can verify if your table has been created successfully by looking at the message displayed by the SQL server, otherwise you can use the following command −

exec sp_columns CUSTOMERS
The above command produces the following output.

TABLE_QUALIFIER   TABLE_OWNER   TABLE_NAME   COLUMN_NAME   DATA_TYPE   TYPE_NAME
   PRECISION   LENGTH SCALE   RADIX   NULLABLE   REMARKS   COLUMN_DEF   SQL_DATA_TYPE 
   SQL_DATETIME_SUB   CHAR_OCTET_LENGTH   ORDINAL_POSITION   IS_NULLABLE   SS_DATA_TYPE
   
TestDB    dbo    CUSTOMERS   ID        4    int      10   4    0      10     0
   NULL   NULL   4   NULL    NULL      1    NO       56 
   
TestDB    dbo    CUSTOMERS   NAME      12   varchar  20   20   NULL   NULL   0
   NULL   NULL   12   NULL   20        2    NO       39
  
TestDB    dbo    CUSTOMERS   AGE       4    int      10   4    0      10     0
   NULL   NULL   4   NULL    NULL      3    NO       56 
 
TestDB    dbo    CUSTOMERS   ADDRESS   1    char     25   25   NULL   NULL   1
   NULL   NULL   1   NULL    25   4    YES  39  

TestDB    dbo    CUSTOMERS   SALARY    3    decimal  18   20   2      10     1
   NULL   NULL   3   NULL    NULL      5    YES      106 

You can now see that CUSTOMERS table is available in your database which you can use to store required information related to customers.

The SQL Server DROP TABLE statement is used to remove a table definition and all data, indexes, triggers, constraints, and permission specifications for that table.

Note − You have to be careful while using this command because once a table is deleted then all the information available in the table would also be lost forever.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax of DROP TABLE statement −

DROP TABLE table_name;

CUSTOMERS table is available in the database, so let us drop it. Following is the command for the same.

DROP TABLE CUSTOMERS; 
Command(s) completed successfully.
With the above command, you will not get any rows.

Exec sp_columns CUSTOMERS; 
No rows\data will be displayed 

The SQL Server INSERT INTO statement is used to add new rows of data to a table in the database.

Syntax
Following are the two basic syntaxes of INSERT INTO statement.

INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME [(column1, column2, column3,...columnN)]   
VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...valueN); 
Where column1, column2,...columnN are the names of the columns in the table into which you want to insert data.

You need not specify the column(s) name in the SQL query if you are adding values for all the columns of the table. But make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. Following is the SQL INSERT INTO syntax −

INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...valueN);

Example
Following statements will create six records in CUSTOMERS table −

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) 
VALUES (1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 );
  
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) 
VALUES (2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 );  

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) 
VALUES (3, 'kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 );  

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) 
VALUES (4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00 ); 
 
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) 
VALUES (5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00 );  

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) 
VALUES (6, 'Komal', 22, 'MP', 4500.00 );

Syntax
You can create a record in CUSTOMERS table using second syntax as follows −

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES (7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00 );
All the above statements will produce the following records in CUSTOMERS table −

ID  NAME       AGE         ADDRESS              SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32          Ahmedabad            2000.00 
2   Khilan     25          Delhi                1500.00 
3   kaushik    23          Kota                 2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25          Mumbai               6500.00 
5   Hardik     27          Bhopal               8500.00 
6   Komal      22          MP                   4500.00 
7   Muffy      24          Indore               10000.00 

Populate One Table Using Another Table
You can populate data into a table through SELECT statement over another table provided another table has a set of fields, which are required to populate first table. Following is the syntax −

INSERT INTO first_table_name  
   SELECT column1, column2, ...columnN  
      FROM second_table_name 
      [WHERE condition];

T-SQL - SELECT Statement

SQL Server SELECT statement is used to fetch the data from a database table which returns data in the form of result table. These result tables are called result-sets.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax of SELECT statement −

SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table_name;

Where, column1, column2...are the fields of a table whose values you want to fetch. If you want to fetch all the fields available in the field, then you can use the following syntax −

SELECT * FROM table_name;

Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS             SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad           2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi               1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota                2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai              6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal              8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                  4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore              10000.00 

Following command is an example, which would fetch ID, Name and Salary fields of the customers available in CUSTOMERS table −

SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS;

The above command will produce the following output.

ID  NAME          SALARY 
1   Ramesh        2000.00 
2   Khilan        1500.00 
3   kaushik       2000.00 
4   Chaitali      6500.00 
5   Hardik        8500.00 
6   Komal         4500.00 
7   Muffy         10000.00 

If you want to fetch all the fields of CUSTOMERS table, then use the following query −

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;

The above will produce the following output.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS              SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad            2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi                1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota                 2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai               6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal               8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                   4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore               10000.00

T-SQL - UPDATE Statement

The SQL Server UPDATE Query is used to modify the existing records in a table.

You can use WHERE clause with UPDATE query to update selected rows otherwise all the rows would be affected.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax of UPDATE query with WHERE clause −

UPDATE table_name 
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2...., columnN = valueN 
WHERE [condition];
You can combine N number of conditions using AND or OR operators.

Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS             SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad           2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi               1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota                2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai              6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal              8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                  4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore              10000.00 
Following command is an example, which would update ADDRESS for a customer whose ID is 6 −

UPDATE CUSTOMERS 
SET ADDRESS = 'Pune' 
WHERE ID = 6; 

CUSTOMERS table will now have the following records −

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS             SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad           2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi               1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota                2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai              6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal              8500.00 
6   Komal      22        Pune                4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore              10000.00 

If you want to modify all ADDRESS and SALARY column values in CUSTOMERS table, you do not need to use WHERE clause. UPDATE query would be as follows −

UPDATE CUSTOMERS 
SET ADDRESS = 'Pune', SALARY = 1000.00;

CUSTOMERS table will now have the following records.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS          SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Pune             1000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Pune             1000.00 
3   kaushik    23        Pune             1000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Pune             1000.00 
5   Hardik     27        Pune             1000.00 
6   Komal      22        Pune             1000.00 
7   Muffy      24        Pune             1000.00 

T-SQL - DELETE Statement

The SQL Server DELETE Query is used to delete the existing records from a table.

You have to use WHERE clause with DELETE query to delete selected rows, otherwise all the records would be deleted.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax of DELETE query with WHERE clause −

DELETE FROM table_name 
WHERE [condition]; 
You can combine N number of conditions using AND or OR operators.

Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS            SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad          2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi              1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota               2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai             6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal             8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                 4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore             10000.00 

Following command is an example, which would DELETE a customer, whose ID is 6 −

DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS 
WHERE ID = 6;
CUSTOMERS table will now have the following records.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS              SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad            2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi                1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota                 2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai               6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal               8500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore               10000.00 
If you want to DELETE all the records from CUSTOMERS table, you do not need to use WHERE clause. DELETE query would be as follows −

DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS;
CUSTOMERS table now will not have any record.

T-SQL - WHERE Clause

The MS SQL Server WHERE clause is used to specify a condition while fetching the data from single table or joining with multiple tables.

If the given condition is satisfied, only then it returns a specific value from the table. You will have to use WHERE clause to filter the records and fetch only necessary records.

The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statement, but it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE statement, etc., which we would examine in subsequent chapters.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax of SELECT statement with WHERE clause −

SELECT column1, column2, columnN  
FROM table_name 
WHERE [condition]
You can specify a condition using comparison or logical operators like >, <, =, LIKE, NOT, etc. The following example will make this concept clear.

Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS            SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad          2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi              1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota               2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai             6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal             8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                 4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore             10000.00 
Following command is an example which would fetch ID, Name and Salary fields from the CUSTOMERS table where salary is greater than 2000.

SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY  
FROM CUSTOMERS 
WHERE SALARY > 2000;
The above command will produce the following output.

ID  NAME       SALARY 
4   Chaitali   6500.00 
5   Hardik     8500.00 
6   Komal      4500.00 
7   Muffy      10000.00

Following command is an example, which would fetch ID, Name and Salary fields from the CUSTOMERS table for a customer with the name Hardik. It is important to note that all the strings should be given inside single quotes ('') whereas numeric values should be given without any quote as in the above example −

SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY  
FROM CUSTOMERS 
WHERE NAME = 'Hardik';
The above command will produce the following output.

ID  NAME     SALARY 
5   Hardik   8500.00 

T-SQL - LIKE Clause

The MS SQL Server LIKE clause is used to compare a value to similar values using wildcard operators. There are two wildcards used in conjunction with the LIKE operator −

The percent sign (%)
The underscore (_)
The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters. The underscore represents a single number or character. The symbols can be used in combinations.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax of % and _.

SELECT *\column-list FROM table_name 
WHERE column LIKE 'XXXX%' 
 
or   

SELECT *\column-list FROM table_name 
WHERE column LIKE '%XXXX%'  

or  

SELECT *\column-list FROM table_name 
WHERE column LIKE 'XXXX_'  

or  

SELECT *\column-list FROM table_name 
WHERE column LIKE '_XXXX'  

or  

SELECT  *\column-list FROM table_name 
WHERE column LIKE '_XXXX_' 
You can combine N number of conditions using AND or OR operators. XXXX could be any numeric or string value.

Example
Following are a number of examples showing WHERE part having different LIKE clause with '%' and '_' operators.

Sr.No	Statement & Description
1	
WHERE SALARY LIKE '200%'

Finds any values that start with 200

2	
WHERE SALARY LIKE '%200%'

Finds any values that have 200 in any position

3	
WHERE SALARY LIKE '_00%'

Finds any values that have 00 in the second and third positions

4	
WHERE SALARY LIKE '2_%_%'

Finds any values that start with 2 and are at least 3 characters in length

5	
WHERE SALARY LIKE '%2'

Finds any values that end with 2

6	
WHERE SALARY LIKE '_2%3'

Finds any values that have a 2 in the second position and end with a 3

7	
WHERE SALARY LIKE '2___3'

Finds any values in a five-digit number that start with 2 and end with 3

Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS            SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad          2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi              1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota               2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai             6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal             8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                 4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore             10000.00 

Following command is an example, which will display all the records from CUSTOMERS table where SALARY starts with 200.

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS 
WHERE SALARY LIKE '200%'; 

The above command will produce the following output.

ID   NAME     AGE     ADDRESS       SALARY 
1    Ramesh   32      Ahmedabad     2000.00 
3    kaushik  23      Kota          2000.00

T-SQL - ORDER BY Clause

The MS SQL Server ORDER BY clause is used to sort the data in ascending or descending order, based on one or more columns. Some database sort query results in ascending order by default.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax of ORDER BY clause.

SELECT column-list  
FROM table_name  
[WHERE condition]  
[ORDER BY column1, column2, .. columnN] [ASC | DESC];
You can use more than one column in the ORDER BY clause. Make sure whatever column you are using to sort, that column should be in column-list.

Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS            SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad          2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi              1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota               2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai             6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal             8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                 4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore             10000.00 

Following command is an example, which would sort the result in ascending order by NAME and SALARY.

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS 
   ORDER BY NAME, SALARY 

The above command will produce the following output.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS           SALARY 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai            6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal            8500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota              2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi             1500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore            10000.00 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad         2000.00

Following command is an example, which would sort the result in descending order by NAME.

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS 
   ORDER BY NAME DESC

The above command will produce the following result −

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS            SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad          2000.00
7   Muffy      24        Indore             10000.00  
6   Komal      22        MP                 4500.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi              1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota               2000.00
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal             8500.00
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai             6500.00  

T-SQL - GROUP BY Clause

The SQL Server GROUP BY clause is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups.

The GROUP BY clause follows the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement and precedes the ORDER BY clause.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax of GROUP BY clause. The GROUP BY clause must follow the conditions in the WHERE clause and must precede the ORDER BY clause if one is used.

SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name 
WHERE [ conditions ] 
GROUP BY column1, column2 
ORDER BY column1, column2 

Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table is having the following records −

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS          SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad        2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi            1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota             2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai           6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal           8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP               4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore           10000.00 

If you want to know the total amount of salary on each customer, then following will be the GROUP BY query.

SELECT NAME, SUM(SALARY) as [sum of salary] FROM CUSTOMERS 
   GROUP BY NAME;

The above command will produce the following output.

NAME        sum of salary 
Chaitali    6500.00 
Hardik      8500.00 
kaushik     2000.00 
Khilan      1500.00 
Komal       4500.00 
Muffy       10000.00 
Ramesh      2000.00

Let us now consider the following CUSTOMERS table having the following records with duplicate names.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS           SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad         2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi             1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota              2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai            6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal            8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore            10000.00 

If we want to know the total amount of salary on each customer, then following will be GROUP BY query.

SELECT NAME, SUM(SALARY) as [sum of salary] FROM CUSTOMERS 
   GROUP BY NAME 

The above command will produce the following output.

NAME        sum of salary 
Hardik      8500.00 
kaushik     8500.00 
Komal       4500.00 
Muffy       10000.00 
Ramesh      3500.00 

T-SQL - DISTINCT Clause

The MS SQL Server DISTINCT keyword is used in conjunction with SELECT statement to eliminate all the duplicate records and fetching only unique records.

There may be a situation when you have multiple duplicate records in a table. While fetching such records, it makes more sense to fetch only unique records instead of fetching duplicate records.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax of DISTINCT keyword to eliminate duplicate records.

SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2,.....columnN  
FROM table_name 
WHERE [condition] 

Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS            SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad          2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi              1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota               2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai             6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal             8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                 4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore             10000.00

Let us see how the following SELECT query returns duplicate salary records.

SELECT SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS 
   ORDER BY SALARY 

The above command will produce the following output where salary 2000 comes twice which is a duplicate record from the original table.

SALARY 
1500.00 
2000.00 
2000.00 
4500.00 
6500.00 
8500.00 
10000.00

Let us now use DISTINCT keyword with the above SELECT query and see the result.

SELECT DISTINCT SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS 
   ORDER BY SALARY 

The above command produces the following output where we do not have any duplicate entry.

SALARY 
1500.00 
2000.00 
4500.00 
6500.00 
8500.00 
10000.00 

T-SQL - Joining Tables

The MS SQL Server Joins clause is used to combine records from two or more tables in a database. A JOIN is a means for combining fields from two tables by using values common to each.

Consider the following two tables, (a) CUSTOMERS table is as follows −

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS             SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad           2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi               1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota                2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai              6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal              8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                  4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore              10000.00 

(b) Another table is ORDERS as follows −

OID  DATE                       CUSTOMER_ID        AMOUNT 
100  2009-10-08 00:00:00.000    3                  1500.00 
101  2009-11-20 00:00:00.000    2                  1560.00 
102  2009-10-08 00:00:00.000    3                  3000.00 
103  2008-05-20 00:00:00.000    4                  2060.00 

Let us join these two tables in our SELECT statement as follows −

SELECT ID, NAME, AGE, AMOUNT 
   FROM CUSTOMERS, ORDERS 
   WHERE  CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID 
OR 
SELECT A.ID, A.NAME, A.AGE, B.AMOUNT 
   FROM CUSTOMERS A inner join  ORDERS B on A.ID = B.Customer_ID 

The above command will produce the following output.

ID   NAME      AGE    AMOUNT 
2    Khilan    25     1560.00 
3    kaushik   23     1500.00 
3    kaushik   23     3000.00 
4    Chaitali  25     2060.00 
It is noticeable that the join is performed in the WHERE clause. Several operators can be used to join tables, such as =, <, >, <>, <=, >=, !=, BETWEEN, LIKE, and NOT; they can all be used to join tables. However, the most common operator is the equal symbol.

MS SQL Server Join Types −

There are different types of joins available in MS SQL Server −

INNER JOIN − Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.

LEFT JOIN − Returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.

RIGHT JOIN − Returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table.

FULL JOIN − Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

SELF JOIN − This is used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the MS SQL Server statement.

CARTESIAN JOIN − Returns the Cartesian product of the sets of records from the two or more joined tables.

T-SQL - Sub-Queries

A sub-query or Inner query or Nested query is a query within another SQL Server query and embedded within the WHERE clause. A sub query is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved.

Sub queries can be used with the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements along with the operators like =, <, >, >=, <=, IN, BETWEEN, etc.

There are a few rules that sub queries must follow −

You must enclose a subquery in parenthesis.

A subquery must include a SELECT clause and a FROM clause.

A subquery can include optional WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses.

A subquery cannot include COMPUTE or FOR BROWSE clauses.

You can include an ORDER BY clause only when a TOP clause is included.

You can nest sub queries up to 32 levels.

Subqueries with SELECT Statement
Syntax
Subqueries are most frequently used with the SELECT statement. Following is the basic syntax.

SELECT column_name [, column_name ] 
FROM   table1 [, table2 ] 
WHERE  column_name OPERATOR 
   (SELECT column_name [, column_name ] 
   FROM table1 [, table2 ] 
   [WHERE]) 
Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS            SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad          2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi              1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota               2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai             6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal             8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                 4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore             10000.00 

Let us apply the following subquery with SELECT statement.

SELECT *  
   FROM CUSTOMERS
   WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY > 4500)

The above command will produce the following output.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS          SALARY 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai           6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal           8500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore           10000.00 

Subqueries with INSERT Statement
Sub queries also can be used with INSERT statements. The INSERT statement uses the data returned from the subquery to insert into another table. The selected data in the subquery can be modified with any of the character, date, or number functions.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax.

INSERT INTO table_name [ (column1 [, column2 ]) ] 
   SELECT [ *|column1 [, column2 ] 
   FROM table1 [, table2 ] 
   [ WHERE VALUE OPERATOR ]
Example
Consider a table CUSTOMERS_BKP with similar structure as CUSTOMERS table. Following is the syntax to copy complete CUSTOMERS table into CUSTOMERS_BKP.

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS_BKP 
   SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS  
   WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM CUSTOMERS)

Subqueries with UPDATE Statement
The subquery can be used in conjunction with the UPDATE statement. Either single or multiple columns in a table can be updated when using a subquery with the UPDATE statement.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax.

UPDATE table 
SET column_name = new_value 
[ WHERE OPERATOR [ VALUE ] 
   (SELECT COLUMN_NAME 
   FROM TABLE_NAME) 
   [ WHERE) ] 

Example
Let us assume we have CUSTOMERS_BKP table available which is backup of CUSTOMERS table.

Following command example updates SALARY by 0.25 times in CUSTOMERS table for all the customers whose AGE is greater than or equal to 27.

UPDATE CUSTOMERS 
   SET SALARY = SALARY * 0.25 
   WHERE AGE IN (SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS_BKP WHERE AGE >= 27 )

This will impact two rows and finally CUSTOMERS table will have the following records.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS             SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad           500.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi               1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota                2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai              6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal              2125.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                  4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore              10000.00 
Subqueries with DELETE Statement
The subquery can be used in conjunction with the DELETE statement like with any other statements mentioned above.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax.

DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME 
[ WHERE OPERATOR [ VALUE ] 
   (SELECT COLUMN_NAME 
   FROM TABLE_NAME) 
   [ WHERE) ] 
Example
Let us assume we have CUSTOMERS_BKP table available which is backup of CUSTOMERS table.

Following command example deletes records from CUSTOMERS table for all the customers whose AGE is greater than or equal to 27.

DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS 
   WHERE AGE IN (SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS_BKP WHERE AGE >=27 )

This would impact two rows and finally CUSTOMERS table will have the following records.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS          SALARY 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi            1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota             2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai           6500.00  
6   Komal      22        MP               4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore           10000.00

T-SQL - Stored Procedures

The MS SQL Server Stored procedure is used to save time to write code again and again by storing the same in database and also get the required output by passing parameters.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax of Stored procedure creation.

Create procedure <procedure_Name> 
As 
Begin 
<SQL Statement> 
End 
Go

Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS            SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad          2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi              1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota               2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai             6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal             8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                 4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore             10000.00 

Following command is an example which would fetch all records from the CUSTOMERS table in Testdb database.

CREATE PROCEDURE SelectCustomerstabledata 
AS 
SELECT * FROM Testdb.Customers 


The above command will produce the following output.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS           SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad         2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi             1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota              2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai            6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal            8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore            10000.00 

More on Stored procedures

A stored procedure in SQL Server is a prepared collection of one or more SQL statements and optional control-of-flow logic that is compiled, stored as a named object in the database, and can be executed repeatedly by name. They serve as modular, reusable code units that centralize data access and business logic. 

Key Features and Benefits
Stored procedures offer several advantages for database management and application development:

Improved Performance: Procedures are compiled the first time they are executed, and an optimized execution plan is cached and reused for subsequent calls. This reduces the overhead of repeatedly compiling SQL statements.

Reduced Network Traffic: Instead of sending multiple lines of individual SQL code across the network, only the procedure's name and any parameters are sent in a single call, minimizing network load.
Enhanced Security: Stored procedures help prevent SQL injection attacks by treating input parameters as literal values, not executable code. They also allow administrators to grant users permission to run a procedure without giving them direct access to the underlying tables, controlling data access.

Code Reusability and Maintainability: Logic for common, repetitive tasks can be written once and called from multiple applications. If the underlying database schema changes, only the stored procedure needs to be updated, rather than every application that uses it.

Modular Programming: They can accept input parameters, return output parameters, and contain programming statements such as IF-ELSE and WHILE loops, allowing for encapsulation of complex business logic directly within the database. 

Types of Stored Procedures in SQL Server

SQL Server supports several types of stored procedures: 
User-Defined Procedures: These are custom procedures created by developers to perform specific tasks tailored to an application's needs. It is best practice not to prefix their names with sp_ to avoid name conflicts with system procedures.

System Procedures: These are predefined procedures provided by SQL Server for administrative tasks and system management (e.g., sp_helptext, sp_rename). They are stored in the internal Resource database but logically appear in every system and user-defined database with the sys schema.

Temporary Procedures: These are dynamic, short-lived procedures stored in the tempdb database. Local temporary procedures start with # and are only visible to the current connection, while global temporary procedures start with ## and are visible to all connections until the last session using them ends. 

Basic Syntax and Execution

Creating a Stored Procedure (T-SQL)

CREATE PROCEDURE ProcedureName 
    @Parameter1 DataType, 
    @Parameter2 DataType OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements and logic go here
    SELECT * FROM TableName WHERE ColumnName = @Parameter1;
    -- Assign value to an OUTPUT parameter
    SELECT @Parameter2 = COUNT(*) FROM TableName; 
END;
GO

Executing a Stored Procedure

EXEC ProcedureName @Parameter1 = 'Value1', @Parameter2 = @OutputVariable OUTPUT;
-- or simply
EXEC ProcedureName 'Value1';


T-SQL - Transactions

A transaction is a unit of work that is performed against a database. Transactions are units or sequences of work accomplished in a logical order, whether in a manual fashion by a user or automatically by some sort of a database program.

A transaction is the propagation of one or more changes to the database. For example, if you are creating a record or updating a record or deleting a record from the table, then you are performing a transaction on the table. It is important to control transactions to ensure data integrity and to handle database errors.

Practically, you will club many SQL queries into a group and you will execute all of them together as a part of a transaction.

Properties of Transactions
Transactions have the following four standard properties, usually referred to by the acronym ACID −

Atomicity − Ensures that all operations within the work unit are completed successfully; otherwise, the transaction is aborted at the point of failure, and previous operations are rolled back to their former state.

Consistency − Ensures that the database properly changes state upon a successfully committed transaction.

Isolation − Enables transactions to operate independently of and transparent to each other.

Durability − Ensures that the result or effect of a committed transaction persists in case of a system failure.

Transaction Control
There are following commands used to control transactions −

COMMIT − To save the changes.

ROLLBACK − To roll back the changes.

SAVEPOINT − Creates points within groups of transactions in which to ROLLBACK.

SET TRANSACTION − Places a name on a transaction.

Transactional control commands are only used with the DML commands INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE only. They cannot be used while creating tables or dropping them because these operations are automatically committed in the database.

In order to use transactional control commands in MS SQL Server, we have to begin transaction with begin tran or begin transaction command otherwise these commands will not work.

COMMIT Command
The COMMIT command is the transactional command used to save changes invoked by a transaction to the database. This command saves all transactions to the database since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK command.

Syntax
Following is the syntax for COMMIT command.

COMMIT; 
Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS           SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad         2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi             1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota              2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai            6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal            8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore            10000.00 
Following command example will delete records from the table having age = 25 and then COMMIT the changes in the database.

Begin Tran 
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS 
   WHERE AGE = 25 
COMMIT 

As a result, two rows from the table would be deleted and SELECT statement will produce the following output.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS           SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad         2000.00
3   kaushik    23        Kota              2000.00
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal            8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore            10000.00 

ROLLBACK Command
The ROLLBACK command is the transactional command used to undo transactions that have not already been saved to the database. This command can only be used to undo transactions since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK command was issued.

Syntax
Following is the syntax for ROLLBACK command.

ROLLBACK
Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS            SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad          2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi              1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota               2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai             6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal             8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP                 4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore             10000.00 

Following command example will delete records from the table having age = 25 and then ROLLBACK the changes in the database.

Begin Tran 
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS 
   WHERE AGE = 25; 
ROLLBACK

As a result, delete operation will not impact the table and SELECT statement will produce the following result.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS          SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad        2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi            1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota             2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai           6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal           8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP               4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore           10000.00 

SAVEPOINT Command
SAVEPOINT is a point in a transaction when you can roll the transaction back to a certain point without rolling back the entire transaction.

Syntax
Following is the syntax for SAVEPOINT command.

SAVE TRANSACTION SAVEPOINT_NAME
This command serves only in the creation of a SAVEPOINT among transactional statements. The ROLLBACK command is used to undo a group of transactions.

Following is the syntax for rolling back to a SAVEPOINT.

ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT_NAME
In the following example, we will delete three different records from the CUSTOMERS table. We will have to create a SAVEPOINT before each delete, so that we can ROLLBACK to any SAVEPOINT at any time to return the appropriate data to its original state.

Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS          SALARY 
1   Ramesh     32        Ahmedabad        2000.00 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi            1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota             2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai           6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal           8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP               4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore           10000.00 
Following are the series of operations −

Begin Tran 
SAVE Transaction SP1 
Savepoint created. 
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID = 1  
1 row deleted. 
SAVE Transaction SP2 
Savepoint created. 
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID = 2 
1 row deleted.
SAVE Transaction SP3 
Savepoint created. 
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID = 3 
1 row deleted.
The three deletions have taken place, however, we have changed our mind and decide to ROLLBACK to the SAVEPOINT that we identified as SP2. Because SP2 was created after the first deletion, the last two deletions are undone −

ROLLBACK Transaction SP2 
Rollback complete. 
Notice that only the first deletion took place since we rolled back to SP2.

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS 
6 rows selected.

ID  NAME       AGE       ADDRESS          SALARY 
2   Khilan     25        Delhi        1500.00 
3   kaushik    23        Kota             2000.00 
4   Chaitali   25        Mumbai           6500.00 
5   Hardik     27        Bhopal           8500.00 
6   Komal      22        MP               4500.00 
7   Muffy      24        Indore           10000.00 

SET TRANSACTION Command
SET TRANSACTION command can be used to initiate a database transaction. This command is used to specify characteristics for the transaction that follows.

Syntax
Following is the syntax for SET TRANSACTION.

SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL <Isolationlevel_name>

T-SQL - Indexes

Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval. Simply put, an index is a pointer to data in a table. An index in a database is very similar to an index at the end of a book.

For example, if you want to reference all the pages in a book that discuss a certain topic, you first refer to the index, which lists all topics alphabetically and are then referred to one or more specific page numbers.

An index helps speed up SELECT queries and WHERE clauses, but it slows down data input, with UPDATE and INSERT statements. Indexes can be created or dropped with no effect on the data.

Creating an index involves the CREATE INDEX statement, which allows you to name the index, to specify the table and which column or columns to index, and to indicate whether the index is in ascending or descending order.

Indexes can also be unique, similar to the UNIQUE constraint, in that the index prevents duplicate entries in the column or combination of columns on which there's an index.

CREATE INDEX Command
Following is the basic syntax of CREATE INDEX.

Syntax
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name
Single-Column Indexes
A single-column index is one that is created based on only one table column. Following is the basic syntax.

Syntax
CREATE INDEX index_name 
ON table_name (column_name)

Example

CREATE INDEX singlecolumnindex 
ON customers (ID)

Unique Indexes
Unique indexes are used not only for performance, but also for data integrity. A unique index does not allow any duplicate values to be inserted into the table. Following is the basic syntax.

Syntax
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name 
on table_name (column_name)

Example

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uniqueindex 
on customers (NAME)

Composite Indexes
A composite index is an index on two or more columns of a table. Following is the basic syntax.

Syntax
CREATE INDEX index_name on table_name (column1, column2) 
Example

CREATE INDEX compositeindex 
on customers (NAME, ID)

Whether to create a single-column index or a composite index, take into consideration the column(s) that you may use very frequently in a query's WHERE clause as filter conditions.

Should there be only one column used, a single-column index should be the choice. Should there be two or more columns that are frequently used in the WHERE clause as filters, the composite index would be the best choice.

Implicit Indexes
Implicit indexes are indexes that are automatically created by the database server when an object is created. Indexes are automatically created for primary key constraints and unique constraints.

DROP INDEX Command
An index can be dropped using MS SQL SERVER DROP command. Care should be taken when dropping an index because performance may be slowed or improved.

Syntax
Following is the basic syntax.

DROP INDEX tablename.index_name
When to Avoid Indexes?
Although indexes are intended to enhance the performance of databases, there are times when they should be avoided. The following guidelines indicate when the use of an index should be reconsidered −

Indexes should not be used on small tables.

Tables that have frequent, large batch update or insert operations should not be indexed.

Indexes should not be used on columns that contain a high number of NULL values.

Columns that are frequently manipulated should not be indexed.
